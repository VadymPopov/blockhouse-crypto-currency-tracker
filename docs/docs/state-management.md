# State Management Explanation

In this project, we used **React Query** for state management. Below is an explanation of why we chose React Query and how it benefits the project.

### Why React Query?

We chose **React Query** for state management for the following reasons:

1. **Simplifies Data Fetching and Caching**:
   React Query automatically manages the fetching, caching, and synchronization of data from the server. This eliminates the need to manually handle state updates, which can often become cumbersome when dealing with data that needs to be fetched or updated frequently.

2. **Efficient Background Data Syncing**:
   React Query provides the ability to sync data in the background. This ensures that the displayed data is always up-to-date, without needing a full page refresh. For example, React Query automatically re-fetches data when the window is focused, ensuring that the user always sees the latest data.

3. **Easy Manual Refetching**:
   With React Query, manual refetching is simple and provides an efficient way to trigger updates. We have implemented a "Refresh" button that allows users to refresh the cryptocurrency prices by manually triggering a refetch of the data.

4. **Error Handling**:
   React Query makes error handling easy by providing error states like `isError`. This allows the app to gracefully handle any issues with data fetching, such as network errors or API failures, and display appropriate messages to users.

5. **Automatic Caching**:
   React Query caches the data by default, reducing the number of requests made to the API. This not only optimizes performance by reducing redundant API calls but also ensures a smoother user experience as the app doesn’t have to re-fetch data unless necessary.

### Conclusion

We chose **React Query** for this project because it provides an out-of-the-box solution for data fetching, caching, error handling, and background syncing. This allows us to focus more on building the UI and user experience, without worrying about complex state management logic. React Query’s simplicity and powerful features made it the best choice for handling dynamic, frequently-updated data like cryptocurrency prices.
